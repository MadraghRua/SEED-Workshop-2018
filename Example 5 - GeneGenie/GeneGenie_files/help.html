	<h2>Help</h2>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	The de novo synthesis of genes is becoming increasingly established in
	synthetic biology and biotechnology as a means to control the assembly
	of amino acids producing active proteins. Current approaches involve
	the synthesis (or purchase) of a number of short oligonucleotides
	(typically ~60 bases in length), which can be assembled together and
	expressed in a host system of interest.
	<p>
	GeneGenie, a new online tool, is introduced to support the
	design of synthetic genes and constructs. GeneGenie allows for the
	design of oligonucleotides encoding the gene sequence optimised for
	expression in any suitable host through an intuitive, easy-to-use web
	interface. The tool ensures consistent oligomer overlap melting
	temperatures, minimises the likelihood of misannealing, optimises
	codon usage for expression in a selected host, allows for
	specification of forward and reverse cloning sequences (for downstream
	ligation) and also provides support for mutagenesis or directed
	evolution studies.
	</p>
	<p>
	Output oligomers can be assembled using PCR-based methods, and
	are fully compatible with our own optimised gene synthesis protocol
	developed alongside GeneGenie. These methods provide highly efficient
	assembly, permitting expression and functional analysis of genes up to
	2 kilobases in length before sequence verification. This represents a
	significant improvement over currently established gene synthesis
	methods.
	</p>
	<p>
	Using this integrated wet- and dry-lab approach, the successful
	synthesis and direct assay of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is
	demonstrated. Novelties of this approach include the specification of
	forward and reverse cloning sequences, facilitating the ligation of
	the designed gene into a vector and its subsequent expression, and the
	optional specification of "variant codons" at given positions. These
	variant codons may include degenerate bases, in addition to the four
	bases A, C, G, and T. Specification of codons including degenerate
	bases allow for variant sequences to be constructed, supporting
	directed evolution studies through the generation of variant
	libraries. For example, specifying the variant codon NTN (where N is
	any nucleotide) will encode a mixture of the amino acids Phe, Leu,
	Ile, Met and Val at that position.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Query</h3>
	
	<h4>Title</h4>
	<p>
	Add a title for the query. This is a free text field, which will be associated with the GeneGenie query
	that is being performed.
	</p>
	<p>
	This title will be propagated to the results, and will be used to name the designed oligos, and can
	therefore be useful in tracking oligomer orders with manufacturers.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is optional.
	</p>
	
	<h4>5' cloning sequence</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the DNA cloning sequence that will be used to ligate the forward sequence into the vector.
	This sequence will be inserted at the 5' end of the gene.
	</p>
	<p>
	This should be a sense strand sequence (reading 5' to 3') and <b>not</b> a reverse or compliment sequence.
	</p>
	<p><b>Hint</b>: Ensure that the gene will be in the correct reading frame after cloning.
	Does the sequence require a starting methionine?
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is optional.
	</p>
	
	<h4><a id="uniProtSearch">Search UniProt</a></h4>
	<p>
	Specify a search term for searching the UniProt database.
	</p>
	<p>
	Upon completion of the search, the user will be prompted with a list of UniProt entries, from
	which one can be selected. Doing so will automatically fill the Protein sequence field, below.
	(See <a href="http://g.gene-genie.appspot.com/help/help.html#proteinSequence">Protein sequence</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
	Use of this field is optional, but the specification of a protein sequence is compulsory.
	(See <a href="http://g.gene-genie.appspot.com/help/help.html#proteinSequence">Protein sequence</a>).
	
	</p><h4><a id="proteinSequence">Protein sequence</a></h4>
	<p>Specify the sequence of the protein which is to be designed.</p>
	<p>Only valid amino acid single-letter codes may be input.</p>
	<p>
		This field may be filled automatically as a result of a UniProt
		search, above. (See <a href="http://g.gene-genie.appspot.com/help/help.html#uniProtSearch">Search UniProt</a>).
	</p>
	<p>This field is compulsory.</p>

	<h5>Variant codons</h5>
	<p>A unique feature of GeneGenie is the facility to specify "variant
		codons" at given positions. These variant codons may include degenerate
		bases, in addition to the four bases A, C, G, and T. Specification of
		codons including degenerate bases allow for variant sequences to be
		constructed, supporting directed evolution studies through the
		generation of variant libraries. For example, specifying the variant
		codon NTN (where N is any nucleotide) will encode a mixture of the
		amino acids Phe, Leu, Ile, Met and Val at that position.</p>
	<p>In order to specify a variant codon, highlight a single residue
		and right-click. This will bring up a menu with two options: Add Variant
		Codon and Remove Variant Codon. Selecting Add Variant Codon will bring up
		the following dialog box, allowing a variant codon to be specified at
		this position:</p>
	<p>
		<img src="./fixedCodon.png" alt="Add Variant Codon dialog box">
	</p>
	<p>A variant codon can be specified, using either specific bases (A,
		C, G, T) or degenerate bases, which encode a mixture of specific
		bases:</p>

	<p>Consequently, specifying a codon of <code>TST</code> will generate a mixture of <code>TCT</code>
	and <code>TGT</code> codon at that position, and therefore encode either Ser or Cys at that position.
	
	</p><h4>3' cloning sequence</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the DNA cloning sequence that will be used to ligate the reverse sequence into the vector.
	This sequence will be inserted at the 3' end of the gene.
	</p>
	<p>
	This should be a sense strand sequence (reading 5' to 3') and <b>not</b> a reverse or compliment sequence.
	</p>
	<p><b>Hint</b>: Does the construct require a stop codon (e.g TAA) after the gene?
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is optional.
	</p>

	<h4>Maximum oligo length</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the maximum length of the designed oligos.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is compulsory.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Melting temperature</h4>
	<p>
	Specified a preferred melting temperature for annealing overlaps.
	</p>
	<p>Note that specifying a higher melting temperature will produce a solution with
	longer overlaps.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is compulsory.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Na+ concentration / M</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the Na+ concentration in M.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is mandatory, and requires values between 0 and 1.
	</p>
	
	<h4>K+ concentration / M</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the K+ concentration in M.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is mandatory, and requires values between 0 and 1.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Tris concentration / M</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the Tris (THAM, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) concentration in M.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is mandatory, and requires values between 0 and 1.
	</p>

	<h4>Mg2+ concentration / M</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the Mg2+ concentration in M.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is mandatory, and requires values between 0 and 1.
	</p>
	
	<h4>dNTP concentration / M</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the dNTP concentration in M.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is mandatory, and requires values between 0 and 1.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Host organism</h4>
	<p>
	Select the host organism in which the oligos will be expressed.
	</p>
	<p>
	This value must be selected from one of the options provided in the autofill box.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is compulsory.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Number of iterations</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the number of iterations for the optimisation algorithm to take. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Improved results <i>may</i> be generated by specifying a larger number than the default of 10000,
	but this will result in longer running times.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is compulsory.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Maximum number of repeating nucleotides</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the maximum number of repeating nucleotides that may be present in the optimised DNA sequence. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Specifying a value of 5 will prevent solutions with six or more repeating nucleotides (e.g. <code>AAAAAA</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
	Preventing long stretched of repeating nucleotides will benefit ligation of the designed oligomers
	and will aid subsequent sequencing of the optimised DNA if required. 
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is compulsory, and must be greater than 3.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Codon mutation rate</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the codon mutation rate. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Specifying a value of 0.01 will result in, on average, mutation of 1% of all codons per iteration
	of the algorithm.
	</p>
	<p>
	For example, with a protein sequence of length 300 amino acids, a codon mutation rate of 0.01 will
	result in, on average, 3 codon mutations per iteration.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is compulsory, and must be between 0 and 1.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Oligo length mutation rate</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the oligo length mutation rate. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In order to optimise codon lengths to ensure consistent melting temperatures of overlapping regions,
	<b>and</b> to maximise the number of requested "Wibble" sites that fall in non-overlapping regions
	(and can therefore be varied for directed evolution studies), oligo lengths are mutated by the algorithm.
	</p><p>
	Specifying a value of 0.01 will result in, on average, mutation of 1% of all oligo lengths per iteration
	of the algorithm.
	</p>
	<p>
	Oligo lengths which are selected to be mutated are varied by +/- 10 nucleotides, taken randomly from a
	uniform distribution.
	</p>
	<p>
	For example, specifying an oligo length mutation rate of 0.02 will result in, on average, the mutation of
	1 oligo from an optimised solution of 50 oligomers per iteration.
	</p>
	<p>
	This field is compulsory, and must be between 0 and 1.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Result</h3>
	<h4><a id="alignment">Alignment</a></h4>
	<p>
	Displays the full alignment of the designed oligomers which make up the gene.
	</p>
	<p>
	The directionality of the oligos (forward or reverse) are indicated by arrows.
	Cloning sequences (both forward and reverse) are underlined.
	</p>
	<p>
	Overlapping regions are highlighted in light blue, and contain a tooltip which
	allows the melting temperature of the overlap to be displayed by holding the
	mouse over the overlap.
	</p>
	<p>
	Requested variant codons are highlighted in bold, and are coloured either green or red.
	Green variant codons are those which were successfully optimised to be in non-overlapping
	regions of the oligos. Red variant codons are those which are found in overlapping regions
	and can therefore not be specified. In these cases, a codon encoding the original amino
	acid will have been selected.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Number of variant codons</h4>
	<p>
	Displays the number of variant codons that have been retained in the optimised sequence.
	</p>
	<p>
	GeneGenie attempts to optimise the oligomer lengths such that requested variant codon sites
	are placed in non-overlapping regions of the oligos. Those variant codons that are placed in
	non-overlapping regions are retained. These are displayed in green on the
	<a href="http://g.gene-genie.appspot.com/help/help.html#alignment">Alignment</a> display.
	</p><p>
	Requested variant codons that cannot placed in overlapping regions cannot be specified.
	In these cases, a codon encoding the original amino acid will have been selected.
	These are displayed in red on the <a href="http://g.gene-genie.appspot.com/help/help.html#alignment">Alignment</a> display.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Codon Adaptation Index</h4>
	<p>
	Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) measures the deviation of the optimised DNA sequence with respect to a
	reference set of highly expressed genes, which is specific to the selected host organism.
	</p>
	<p>
	CAI provides an indication of gene expression level under the assumption that there is translational
	selection to optimize gene sequences according to their expression levels. Consequently, GeneGenie
	will attempt to optimise the DNA sequence to favour codons that are found in highly expressed genes.
	</p>
	<p>
	CAI ranges from 0 to 1, with a CAI of 1 representing a sequence containing only the most frequently
	observed codons in highly expressed genes.
